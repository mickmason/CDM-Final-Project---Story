Posts, content
Overall there should be a clear, consistent message which is carried through all posts.

Stories, articles, posts must live up to their headline. 
Make them informative, interesting, enjoyable, have a point to them.

Content should be specifically about digital story telling and also about the broader creative worlds of art, design, photography, film making, literature, street art and so on. It should include interesting stories about creativity in each field and trends and developments in each; it should encourage people to get involved with digital storytelling and exploring creativity.
